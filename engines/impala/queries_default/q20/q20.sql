--Customer segmentation for return analysis: Customers are separated
--along the following dimensions: return frequency, return order ratio (total num-
--ber of orders partially or fully returned versus the total number of orders),
--return item ratio (total number of items returned versus the number of items
--purchased), return amount ration (total monetary amount of items returned ver-
--sus the amount purchased), return order ratio. Consider the store returns during
--a given year for the computation.

-- in case you wonder about the structure of the select part
-- hive 0.12 has a bug requiring data-type of x == data-type of y in: "CASE WHEN <condition> THEN x ELSE y"
-- because auto-up-casting will not work!
-- e.g. let x be some table column of type BigInt and y = 1 then:
-- "CASE WHEN <condition> THEN x ELSE 1" will fail because 1 is "int" and not "bigint" but:
-- "CASE WHEN <condition> THEN x ELSE 1L" will work because 1L is of type "bigint"
